### Introduction to Amazon VPC Lattice

Amazon VPC Lattice is a fully managed application networking service that you use to connect, secure, and monitor the services for your application. You can use VPC Lattice with a single virtual private cloud (VPC) or across multiple VPCs from one or more accounts.

Modern applications can consist of multiple small and modular services, which are often called **microservices**. While modernization has its advantages, it can also introduce networking complexities and challenges when you connect these microservices. For example, if the developers are spread across different teams, they might build and deploy microservices across multiple accounts or VPCs.

In VPC Lattice, we refer to a microservice as a **service**.
